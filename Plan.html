        <p>As mentioned, before we are inspired IT students hoping to break into the IT industry utilising our creative, artistic and technical talents all poured into this app. Our main objective for producing this app is to develop an app that will enable a user to input clothes that they already own into the app which it will then produce outfits that the user may have not ever thought of before. This will be done through a 3D model that will be created by the user by either entering their age, height and gender or by using the slide bars to specifically alter certain aspects of the model e.g., waist size, leg length, shoulder size etc. The user may also wish to generate outfits of clothing pieces they do not currently already own. If the user wishes to purchase the piece the app will designate them to another website or store where the clothing piece is being sold at the best and lowest prices. The user may also wish to input a piece of clothing they don’t already own or already own onto the 3D model to see whether they wish to purchase the piece or not. This will allow for creative freedom for the user as they may develope and create outfits as they please. This may assist people with time as the user is not required to try on multiple outfits to determine if they like it or not. The app will also be a money saver and a great tool to allow the user to see if it’s a worthy investment or not. Furthermore, users will also save much money as they will have access to great deals that they otherwise would have never known about.  We wish for the app to be utilised by industry giants as well such as Nike, adidas or designer brands such as LV, Gucci, Chanel etc. They may reap in the benefits of this app as they may upload their own clothing designs onto the app and visualise their creative ideas through a 3D model. However, the app has a great emphasis on a simple design created for the general consumer to use. There are many great ways to use the app and its outcome is dependent on the user.

          How we plan on achieving as such is through, great planning and brainstorming process. We first required a wireframe to visualise how we wished for our app to be mapped out at its core. This involved inputting where the login or sign up button would be, where the screen to select clothes to purchase should be, how we were going to implement our clothing generating screen etc. This was all done through Figma as Figma offers many tools to design and create an app. Once we had our wireframes we needed to consider how we were going to create our algorithm. After intensive research, we discovered another project that had a similar concept to ours. However, their code instead revolved around food. Their project allowed the user to input ingredients that they already had in the fridge which then generated a dish they could make with their available ingredients. We wish to work around this code and make it our own by changing the “ingredients” to “clothes” such as shirts, jumpers, pants etc. Although having a blueprint we still lacked the general knowledge of how to make this code our own and change it enough that it will work and won't be a direct copy and paste. This will be one of many hurdles we encounter.

          <p>Once hitting a wall with the code, we decided to instead create a prototype for our app. As a pair, we agreed that it had to be vibrant and colourful to match our “aesthetic” while being minimal and simplistic to create a more elegant look. This, however, also further worked to our benefit as a simplistic app will ensure users can easily navigate the app and reach where they are searching for. The prototype had to include pictures, colours and clear buttons to not leave anything ambiguous or difficult to understand. Nevertheless, once the prototype was completed, we had to then work on our finished product. The app had to be further refined to implement further ideas we thought of down the track. A major idea that we agreed on was to change from a game app that was originally going to be implemented to more of a fashion app. We thought that this would have been a better trajectory for the app as it would have been slightly easier to implement and had greater potential in the long run. John and Johnson pitched many great ideas that should have been implemented within the app. Such as a 3D model to create a closer depiction of a character the user wanted e.g., a taller person with shorter arms, shorter person with a long torso etc. Furthermore, the core of our application idea being that of the outfit generator was also a difficult endeavour mentioned previously. We thought about implementing a simpler concept such as providing the user the best deals for a particular outfit or clothing piece they sought interest in.

          <p>This project idea stemmed from one of our old group members who thought of the idea during a previous assignment. Once forming a group with us for a different idea the person shared their ideas with us which we thought were far greater than the ideas we managed to put out. Everything seemed to be a success at the end of the day. However, once assignment three reached at the time of writing the said group member abandoned both the project and our group leaving us without a word. This highly disorientated the two remaining members as work required from the leaving member had not needed to be covered by those who remained. With the remaining members, we decided that it was for the best interest of the app that it turned into more of a fashion app rather than a gaming one. Although this would soon text not only skills and work ethic but the chemistry within our team. Furthermore, the idea of turning the application into more of a fashion app came from Johnson after he had a conversation with a friend on determine what to wear to a music festival. He jokingly said that many participants of the music festival wore very interesting outfits, and it was as if an app randomly generated their outfits for the event as it could not have been thought of by a regular person. This idea was later reinforced when another group member Lisa presented her idea on a fashion app that was a game had a similar concept. However, with Lisa leaving the group abruptly, things took a significant turn. We could no longer pursue her idea of a game anymore as neither John or Johnson had any experience or knowledge within this realm, but a fashion app pitched by Johnson was far more plausible as it had not required much experience within the realm and there seems to be an absence of apps that offered such a feature or service. The app would be one of the first of its kind, starting our pursuit of this very difficult application.

      <p>For the official app in terms of features developed most of the more intricate components and key features are still required to be implemented. We must first find a way to implement a 3D model within our app. After doing research we discovered that Figma offered this however, this came in the form of mainly objects and shapes, which was not what we needed as we required a human figure for the app. During this process, we also had to find a way to add sliding bars into our app so that the user may configure how the model looked although before even touching on changing how the model looked we needed a way to implement the sliding bars without it we cannot have the end product. We in the end concluded that programming an algorithm to generate outfits was far out of our reach and experience. We found that no amount of rigorous research would make up for the experience or skill set to perform the task.  </p>

      <p>We realised during the prototyping stage that implementing much of what we want will not only be difficult but possibly not conceivable. Our app at the time of writing has most of its components in terms of the structuring of the app and how we wish to present our app to the user. We had successfully created a home screen, buy screen login screen etc. Everything matched how we wished the app to look and we even managed to partially incorporate the sliding bars for the 3D model. However, the user cannot physically move the bars as it is only for show. We also removed our previous placeholders for some of our apps such as the 3D model which was previously just a stick figure and a genuine buy screen which also only previously offered a couple of buttons that looked nowhere near to what it is now. The user may operate the app and browse around although slightly restricted to only a couple of clothing products they may still wish to view it on the models we have created. Although far from what we originally entailed this application out to be we have made a substantial amount of progress. Which we may continue on in the future and eventually create a product satisfactory for publishing onto the app store. We hope that with our future skills we will be able to finish this app as it will truly show employers our ambition, creative ideas and technical experience. Nevertheless, the app has a long way to go but at the current state, we are relatively satisfied with what we have for a 2 person project.

                <p>
                  The project idea chosen is a sort of mobile app which can generate outfit ideas for someone with the clothes that they already have. This app would be designed in the style of a sort of customisable game, where users can modify how their character looks to replicate how they look as well. It would be a more in-depth character customisation in comparison to other ‘dress up’ games as it would need to mirror what the user looks like so that the user themselves are able to judge how the generated outfit would suit them. It would also have components for users to add their current wardrobe.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This app would entail a lot of different features for people to replicate and enjoy the outfits that they create. It has been envisioned to be somewhat like an animated game, where people can input their physical features into the character, such as height, or body type. And unlike other ‘dress up’ applications, this app would allow users to choose the sizing of the outfits that they input into the game. This enables users to see how the size of the outfit would fit onto their body. For example, if I were to want to wear a size XS shirt in men’s, it would look a lot different on my body compared to wearing a XS in women’s. Having this customisation allows the user to know exactly how the clothing would fit on their body, if something may be a tight fit or if it would be loose and oversized. To allow this to be realistic and produced by the team, we would need to make the sizings limited to S, M, L, to avoid complications within the process.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This app would also characterise different brands of clothing pieces inside the built-in store. Stores and other businesses could collaborate with this app, such as Nike, if they wanted to advertise their new clothing pieces, they may be able to add it into the store as well, allowing customers to try it on virtually onto their animated clone, and decide if it would match with the other clothing items that they may already have in their closet. And because of the in-depth customisation, users would know how the clothing item would personally fit on them, before online purchasing. This eliminates most of the online purchase fails, where people buy things online that end up not fitting them or not looking right.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As for the game aspect, people can take internal photos of their characters and send them to their friends, being able to customise the background of their app as well to make it more personalised, or even customise the poses of their character, to give it more of a personality. Some apps that I might take inspiration from is Snapchat’s ‘Bitmoji’, except the app would allow users to see the full 3D render of their character. Maybe within the app, if it were to be advanced, it could have a feature where the app would determine the user’s animated character through a photo instead of having to manually type in all the features of the character.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Software that may be used is animation software to generate the actual character, such as ‘room 8 studio’ which creates sculpted 3D characters. After creating these characters, they can be inputted into a gaming animation software, such as ‘unity’ to create movement of the character within the game. From this app, character animation can come to life, but also add ones and movements of clothing pieces may also be added to the program. Having each physical feature of the character such as hair and eyes separate from the actual body during the animation process would enable users to customise their character in any way they want, perhaps by swiping between different styles. All the outfits that are imputed would need to be added into a random generator as well, so that users are able to randomly generate their outfits. Also because of the added external feature of the weather app, that would also need to be included in some way, possibly an attachment through GITHUB, which would also be used to create the links for the incorporated stores inside of the app. A difficult part in achieving this is understanding mobile app development and putting all these features together to make them work. Future improvements to the app may include the possibility to generate the outfits in a certain style, such as minimal or chic.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Skills that would be needed is the understanding of these animation software. This could be aided by someone in the design department, someone who is able to interact with animation software. But also integrating the animation into the app itself would be quite difficult. Hardware required would be a phone, to test and utilise the app itself. Another difficult aspect is how to incorporate a small store inside of the app without overwhelming the user with the amount of content that is already in there. Which is also a main issue, how to create an application like this that is easy to use for the users despite the number of features integrated into the app. So, a software to organise these into their intended categories would also be needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A future added feature is something like a store, for the clothing items. The users will be able to generate their own clothes with the items in the fake stores, each item will also have a mini description and the option to change its colours or sizings. While everything may be animated, users are able to go to the store and search for other clothing items that they might like, click on it, which would bring them to a list of places where a similar item may be sold in real life. These descriptions will include images and direct links to the actual item and also create a more convenient way to shop as well. 
                </p>
                <p>
                The user may also be able to semi customise the outfits, where they can lock in a specific item, such as a top that they may want to wear, and the app would generate all the other pieces of clothing around it, in order to complete the fit.
                </p>
                <p>
                It would also be tailored for users with a specific outfit idea that they already have in mind, perhaps a monochrome look, they may be able to select the colour of clothing articles that is generated. 
                </p>
                <p>
                An external feature that could also be added is the weather, it would be presented as a sort of widget on the app which allows users to tailor what the generator would generate based on what the weather is like. But again this may be a bit of a stretch, and can be pushed back for the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                As an addition to this app to include everyone's ideas, we have decided for future improvements, to incorporate the function of facial recognition, or more so figure recognition as an advancement of the application. Using tools such as ‘Microsoft Computer Vision API’ or ‘Autodesk 123D’ which captures images and turns them into 3D models. More specifically, this software captures images taken from the camera and generates 3D images through the cloud, with both texture and visual information within minutes. This would definitely be useful in the terms of creating human models of the user, and transforming this model into a more animated character to input into the game. The result would be an animated version of the user, and by using this technology we would be able to cut down on the time it would need to take the user to create their own model digitally, with questions and adjustments. We have also collectively agreed on utilising chatterbots in order to effectively communicate with the user and their needs, as well as to implement the idea of a game and create a more fun way to generate one’s clothes. Perhaps even create a mascot to guide the user’s through the application, like ‘Qiqi’ in the game ‘Genshin Impact’, which can talk to users in game and allows. The chatterbox inputted can be presented as the mascot instead, again in order to communicate with the user’s in a more interactive way, which can answer questions such as what sex the user would want their character to be , instead of bombarding the user’s with a list of options of how they would want their character to appear which can create a more enjoyable process. We also considered Johnson’s project idea of having an app which helps users find the lowest prices for items. It would enable the app to have the lowest prices for the feature of the app where a store is incorporated. With this feature, users are able to generate their own outfits with items that they do not already own in their closet, and the store will allow them to search for similar items to the articles of clothing that they have chosen, but with the right price range. This idea can be implemented in the future as an advancement for the app instead of something to add now, especially taking into consideration the lack of skills we currently have.
                </p>
                <p>
                As for now, with the plan to somehow create a prototype of this app, the group has decided to keep it simple, and create a quality app instead of an application with multiple features that may or may not succeed. Ideally for the prototype, we are planning to generate a simple app which can generate a few basic animated clothing items on a customisable character. This character will be able to be customised with minimal features such as skin tone, height, sex, hair and a few 3-4 body types. We would be able to perhaps add a colour wheel into the app itself to enable users to change the colours of the clothing. But other than that, the more advanced features may need to wait until future improvements.
                </p>
                <p>
                If this project is successful, it would be able to create a more efficient way of dealing with clothes in the morning and save everyone a lot of time, whether its children or adults who need to decide what to wear. It would also create a way for others to shop more efficiently and prevent them from buying things online that may not fit or suit their body type. Overall eliminating a lot of waste of time and money. In conclusion, the outcome would be an outfit generator app, which can be interacted with like a game, making outfit picking both fun and time efficient!

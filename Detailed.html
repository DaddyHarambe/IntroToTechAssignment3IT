      <h1>Aim</h1>
      <p>The aim of our project is to develop an app that is friendly and adaptable for users. We envisioned that “beauty in minimal” this is because we wanted to create an app where people can view many brands and their clothes. We want to give the users all the best experience with FashStation. The group believes that teamwork is a required part of a project, as there wouldn’t be anything done and with the lack of communication, there would not be a product for the users. </p>

          <div class="course-col">
            <h1>Group Processes and communication</h1>
            <p>The group has all agreed to communicate our calls through Microsoft teams. Microsoft teams is an application that allows users to create groups and share their work. This allows easy access to view all our work together as we are using Microsoft teams word to write our project while having a meeting. Microsoft enables our teacher to join the meetings and view our documents when needed. The application lets us record the meetings which is needed in the assignment and if any of the group members forget their task, they can rewatch the meeting. The group agrees when we should have the next meeting after giving a set task during the call. Depending on how much work is given, the next meeting is at least every 3-4 to allows everyone to have time to get their set task done, unless we are very behind, we would have a meeting roughly 2-3. Communicating through the meetings reassures each member, letting them know what each person has completed and will be doing. If we need assistances from each other or letting each know information, we would communicate the messages through Facebook messenger. If in a case where we do not have communication with a group member where they do not reply, the group will contact the teacher letting them know that they have not been responding and if they have not done any work or their set task. If the person who has not been responding has not done any work, the rest of the members would evaluate and decide whether to wait for them to respond or continue the project without them. If we are behind due to a member not contributing, we would notify the teacher and possibly ask for special consideration.

              <h1>Roles</h1>
              <p>As the project moves along towards the finishing date the roles for each member become more defined. Within the group John represents us through his role as the User Interface Designer, designing and managing much of the website. However, his work also includes assisting Lisa through the prototyping and wireframes process. He has created out first quick prototype on figma while also developing the website for the group. Johnson’s role within this assignment as indicated by others as well is through the role of Tech Project Manager. His role ensures social cohesion occurs within the group. He has the large responsibility of setting deadlines and making sure that all members provide work that is required whether it be through following up with said person or seeing if he himself or another member may cover for that member. His role is also to oversee any work that has been done within the group and ensuring that it is up to standard and meeting the rubric and assessment outlines. However, his role does not only come with managing the team or setting up required meetings but also contributing for work within the group. Being the leader typically means that they must hold themselves accountable for their actions and work that is done and to maintain a certain level of standard although with assistance from other members from time to time. Whereas Lisa’s role within the group is that of a designer she oversees the aesthetic of the app and making sure everything is pleasing to the eye and nothing is feeling or being congested. She has designed and sketched drawings dedicated to the app while also contributing and communicating with John during the prototyping process and the finished product as she must continually update and change the app’s design within the process. However, at the core every member of the group does not always have specifically dedicated roles as each member supports each other in separate ways and being a smaller group of three everyone must contribute to all the work that is done from writing to the document to designing and creating the app and website.

              <h3>Testing</h3>
              <p>By the end of the assignment, we intend to have a finished app generated through figma with all the intended wireframes wired correctly. In terms of success ideally like all apps we hope for it to run smoothly and not crash at any point within the process. Although that is only the bare minimum for us. We hope that at the end of this assignment we will have produced an app that we are all satisfied with and content with. This means that our algorithm for generating the clothes is successful although this may come with its hitches. Furthermore, we hope that the app when provided with an input e.g., pressing the login button, the app will run through that process. However, the app must also remain aesthetically pleasing and to a certain degree minimalistic so that users may navigate and understand the information in an efficient manner without being stuck or not being able to get to where they intend to be. At the end of the day, we also want a product that may be realistically added to the app store despite it being a far reach we intend to aim high.
              </p>
              <p>For our first test the pictures here indicate and depict our first prototype. It was relatively successful as it enabled us to realise and see how we wish to structure the app and its design. The general and basic wireframes also reassured us that the core of the app works however, still requires further refinement and more design elements such as colour and pictures. Although we are satisfied with how the prototype turned out as it will provide us with a foundation to work upon. The key features such as the login button, search button and menu button are also a success. This mainly only leaves us with the extra design elements and to implement an algorithm that will choose outfits for us to generate within the application. This will of course result in further wireframes being implemented so that the user may access this feature. Now that it is complete, we wish to get the prototype user tested by as many people as possible within a couple of days. Ideally, we achieve a sample of 20 users. Users are not required to have any prior knowledge as we only wish to see how accessible the prototype is. We wish to do another user test once the completion of our app is done.

          <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
          <p>The primary tool that will be utilised for the prototyping and wireframes is figma. This enables us to create an application and make our project idea into reality. Through Figma we are also able to see how we wish to configure the design of the app and how it will be structured. We intend to add more diagrams and visual elements to elevate the design of our app. This is intended to create a more elegant and pleasing design for the app while also relating to our project idea. We wish to make a fashionable design that does not clutter our app. Furthermore, to generate our website we will be using HTML and CSS which one of our members are proficient with. We will likely be coding this on Atom as it’s practicality and ease of use will allow us to work more swiftly. Through Atom we will be able to create a beautiful website without it being too congested with information at a given time. Furthermore, we wish for our app to have some form or algorithm that will generate clothing ideas with the given input the user applies. This would require coding and research to both comprehend and successfully incorporate. The primary language for this would come in the form of Python as this is the language most of us are decently proficient and the easiest to pick up through some research.

          <h1>Scopes And Limits</h1>
          <p>The project is set out to be done within a timeframe, this may result in an outcome that may not be able to be accomplished. However, our main goal is to create a prototype using figma to be able to be displayed to others this is due to the lack of members. If we had more members. The final product of the app will not be our end goal due to the time limit and the lack of group members we have. This project is designed to be for 4-6 people however with only 3 people making this project, it becomes difficult for us to accomplish this goal. The end goal was to create the app using the appropriate software where users can test our products and view them on their character. We may not have the technology such as having the ability to obtain clothing or a brand that would allow us to use their clothes for this project.

          <h1>Risks</h1>
          <p>There are many risks in doing this project, a risk that could be identified is that as the group is creating a new app, there is a possibility that we do not have enough knowledge to be able to produce a successful app. With this project having a limited timeframe, there would be possibility of the group no being able to learn the software and coding to create FashStation. As the project is based on an online shop, this concept is new to the members and require a lot of studying and learning. The software that is selected to create the app could be a software studying and trial and error as it is new to the members.  Having many trials and error could also affect the chance of finish the project as there could be a problem is could not be fix due to our limit knowledge on the software. Furthermore, the risk of miss communication or the lack of communication before each member can affect the result of the project. This could happen due to a team member not cooperating and not implementing their work.  Not implementing their work that was assigned today can delay the project as the work could be important and is needed before the project can continue. This could result in not being able to get as much that is done wanted or even complete the project in the set timeframe.
           </p>
           <p>Another risk could be an operation risk, this is the change in the team processes. The group members could change roles unexpectedly could impact the project as the change in management or process could lead the team to have distractions and adjustments. These adjustments could take a while which may delay the project timeline. Moreover, the cost of the project could be a risk. This occurs when the spending of the budget is too high for the group’s budget. A high budget risk could be the software cost more than anticipated. </p>

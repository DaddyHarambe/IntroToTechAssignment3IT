              <p>Overall, this assignment opposed to the previous was an utter and complete disaster. Entering the assignment with only 3 group members we were already short on group members compared to other groups who had 4 to 6. Lisa abandoning the group further brought upon the group extra weight that the two remaining members being me and John had to carry. Unnecessary stress was brought on as everything went into a blaze. However, what did go well was that we managed to do practically most of the document if not the whole thing between the two of us, while also creating an app, prototype, website and wireframes. The quality of work has been clearly reflected within this assignment as the workload proved too much for just two people. One thing that could have been improved or worked on is considering different group members and perhaps having more who will not completely be absent without word. As a group I learnt that many of the times if you want work to be done you just have to do it yourself. Although one thing I found surprising was that we managed to complete the work although alleviated with the extension courtesy of Anthony Clapp.

              <p>Personally, this assignment has been a difficult for each member that has actually contributed. With a missing group member who abandoned Johnson and I with no communication and work. It made it difficult as we had to delay the work due to us waiting for her to contribute her work like she said she would when she was still communicating. we both agreed that she would not be contributing anymore, it finally allowed us to continue our work and separating Lisa's work between Johnson and I. Luckily, Johnson is a leader and pushed me to get extra work done. Having each person doing what we were strong out helped us get what we needed to do to finish this assignment. We were finally able to complete the work although it wasn’t as much as we expected it to be, but we were able to do as much as we could within the timeframe we had. We made sure that Anthony would know what happened with Lisa and asked for an extension which he allowed, this helped us extremely as it allowed us more to time to complete the assignment.

      <h1>Goup's Thoughts</h1>
  <p>As a pair Johnson and John were able to complete much of the tasks that were thrown at them. They faced many hurdles and at times dead ends that they never thought they could move passed with. However, with Johnson’s persistence and leadership paired with John’s dedication the duo managed to pull through and complete the assignment. Being only a duo completing the assignment proved extremely rough and challenging for the two although it was not all bad. John’s fast learning allowed him to learn Figma in a short span of time and his previous knowledge of HTML and CSS enabled him to both create the prototype and website with Johnson’s creative advice. Johnson spent most of his time creating the document ensuring that everything met the assignment outline while keeping it up to his standards. Although, one major issue that could be resolved like the previous assignment is that some of the work required was not done till very late or put off for a long period of time. However, this was shortly counteracted as members of the pair ensured that they each finished their part of the work. One thing that was incredibly surprising was the abandonment of a group member. The said group member left without a word and contributed nothing to this assignment or project. Their leave left the two remaining members in disarray and dumbfounded. It is still unclear as to why they left as in a previous assignment there was great cooperation with the said member and despite handing in work late, they still managed to provide work. Nevertheless, there was much to learn from this experience in order to complete work each member had to have each other’s backs. If a member wasn’t motivated or falling behind it is the role of the other members to ensure that they get back on track and understand the team’s commitment. The group must have clear communication as to not confuse anyone and to ensure that all members of the group understand what they are doing and what needs to be done by them. Ensure that each member helps each other out and to not be afraid to ask questions or support from other members who may know or understand a certain concept better. One large thing the group learnt was that to designate tasks to each member’s strengths. In this case John’s strengths were with HTML and CSS, the more technological side of the assignment. Whereas Johnson’s strength was within writing and comprehension, due to past experiences through essay writing etc.

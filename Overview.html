          <h1>Topic</h1>
          <p>The general outcome of this project is expected to be that we as a group develop an app that is both viable and fantastic to look at. We seek to build a fashion app that will change how people use and make fashion apps. We wish to provide not only well-crafted outfits for the user but also a way to provide them with the best deals for clothes. This should enable those who are previously hesitant to purchase clothes to finally get the piece they have always wanted or a way to reassure them that it may not be the best fit. However, the app is utilised we wish all those who operate and use the app benefit from it whether it be through a practical sense or a money saving one.   </p>
          <p>We hope not only to create a marvellous app but to also create a product that may be seen by larger companies to either further invest into our idea or for them to gain inspiration to create a greater app with a larger budget and more qualified team. Our only wish is to initialize something in a different app realm that has not yet been vastly explored yet which may see benefits if further invested into. This app has vast potential to grow with a more developed team. Furthermore, we wish to see where this app may take us with our current skill set. We potentially hope to allow the user to to further their creative mind with our app.  </p>

          <h1>Motivation</h1>
          <p>Breaking into the IT industry as newcomers we as a group felt like we had to prove ourselves. We had to make an idea that was obtainable, realistic, and different. As a group we felt a pressure to impress especially to a wider audience. We find significance in this project as we believe all those who use it may benefit through its usage. There are few apps out there that do what we set this app out to do and we plan to change that. We plan to create a high-quality app that will fit in with modern trends and a user interface that will be up to notch with our competitors. Despite currently lacking the skills to create a full-fledged app we believe that our app FashStation may make a change within the fasion app realm. This app may spark a larger company to develop a greater app or provides us an opportunity to begin this revolution. Future employers may gravitate to this app through its aesthetically pleasing design, simple yet beautiful. This app will not only delineate our artistic design but also our ingenuity and technical knowledge. If successful we may program an algorithm that will generate vast amounts of clothing outfits many may have never thought of. Although a simple app we see much potential and hope that this is only the beginning of something larger.

          <p>Our app FashStation allows users to test out clothes on a character of themselves, a similar app that has been produced is Bitmoji. Both apps authorise users to customises their character, such as changing the body type, hair colour and facial features. Bitmoji allows the user to create a character just like themselves or someone desire. The Bitmojis are then abled to be viewed by the userâ€™s friends. FashStation lets try on different clothing from assorted brands. The main difference between our app and bitmoji is that FashStation is also a shop, where they can view branded products on their characters and purchase it on the app.  With the recent event of Covid-19, the rise of online shopping has drastically increased, clothes are one of the most bought items, Shopping online can provide conveniency and mostly safety.  As people are online shopping, they are not able to try on the clothes and to see what it would look like on them. FashStation would help with that, as people can select a fit such as shirt, pant, and shoes and view it all together on a character, which the user has made.

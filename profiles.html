            <h3>JOHNSON</h3>
            <p>Hello everyone, my name is Johnson Nguyen I am a proud student at RMIT city campus. My student ID is 3943851 and my email address is s3943851@student.rmit.edu.au. I come from a line of Vietnamese immigrants and can fluently speak the language. An interesting fact that many may not know about me is that one of my personal greatest achievements is obtaining a 160kg deadlift in the gym which was over double my body weight being only 78kg at the time. I have also recently completed Elden Ring and now have endeavoured onto Sekiro again. IT originally was not my main interest, as it belonged to business where I planned to get into commerce. However, after many months of pondering and research I had realised IT was a much more lucrative field and the work to social life balance was much greater with higher employment. I have always had great interest in technology however, lacked great industry experience.

            <h3>LISA</h3>
            <p>I am Lisa! I am an Asian Australian who was born and raised in Melbourne. Currently I am a full time first year student at RMIT studying a Bachelor of Information Technology and am also working part time on the side. I am a mixture of Vietnamese and Chinese, and am fully fluent in speaking, reading and writing in Vietnamese, but unfortunately cannot for the life of me speak or understand Chinese. I am usually quite busy trying to balance work and university, however when I do find spare time, I usually spend it playing games or doing something creative. I enjoy art and love making and fixing clothes, partially because nothing fits me, but also because I find mending things quite therapeutic. I also spend a lot of my time going out with my friends, and particularly this year, I have been trying to explore new things and creating new memories plus experiences. I love being outdoors, but I also really love my PC set up, so I spend a lot of time at home as well.

  <h1>Group Processes</h1>
<p>Our group for assignment 2 got a score of 69.75/100. Based on our results the group were a complete each section very well, however the group agreed that we need to go into more depth and explain each section more thoroughly. Everyone was assigned a job and knew what they were doing. The group was able to explore each idea and have relevant information for each section required.For assignment 3, The group has decided to give us more time and to start earlier than we did for assignment 2. Using assignments 2 feedback to help and implement them into this assignment is one of our main goals. Some feedback that was given to us was to include more diagrams and photos. We will also attempt to communicate and have more meetings to help each other and to check if we’re all on track. A pivotal error within assignment 2 that must be addressed within the next assignment being assignment 3 is providing worked upon the agreed time. This also means that everyone must contribute their work efficiently and effectively without delaying the group. Despite only having three members within the group communication was difficult and agreed upon meetings were delayed many times due to last minute plans popping up for some or circumstances that could not be helped. Within this assignment we wish to dedicate for time to our assignment and remain more committed to both our work and the agreed upon meeting times without further prolonging it. We must also prioritise this work instead of other activities as it has resulted us handing our last assignment in late. Although when members of the group dedicate their time and truly focus much work is done within a short span of time, however this is sometimes overestimated resulting in late work.

  <h1>Career plans</h1>
  <p>At the stem, our jobs are relatively similar as it requires our technical thinking of technology to communicate back to the company or business as of which we are employed by. The role of a business analyst is to review how a business operates creating greater efficiencies for the future of the business while also leading project teams and relaying their knowledge and technical understanding back to the business. Whereas a Development Engineer (DevOps) an occupation which entails the engineer to merge and collaborate software development and IT operations to create more efficient and faster growth in the company’s software. However, business analyst (BA) differ from a DevOps engineer as a business analyst requires one to review current technologies within a business and implement existing software or processes that may increase its efficiency. This requires a (BA) to consistently communicate with the company and their team to lead them efficiently and effectively. DevOps, however, are typically more independent in their work and it is their role to create new software from scratch. A cybersecurity analyst is like DevOps as they typically work independently and require greater levels of technical thinking than a BA. Their role is to ensure a business is protected from cyber-attacks and does not require them to increase the efficiency of the business like a DevOps engineer or a BA.

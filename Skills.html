      <p>We are a group consisting of three members with an ambitious dream and goal of making a successful fashion app for users of all ages to access. The app includes a feature for the user to input what types of clothing pieces they have in which the algorithm will generate an outfit befitting of what they own and have. However, this is not the only extent of the app as it also offers the user generated outfits with pieces of clothing of which the user does not yet own. The user may also wish to purchase the pieces of clothing directly from the app as the app will suggest the cheapest store for said clothes. This will also be done as at the beginning of the app the user will create a quick model of a person intended for the user to create a model of themselves or a model of another person to best see their outfits come to reality. However, our group members lack the skills, knowledge, time and funding to produce an application of such calibre. This is where we wish to have further assistance from those who are more experienced and specialise in their field. These roles include an app designer, backend developer, mobile developer and tech project manager. These 4 roles will provide the foundation and core for the development team as each role offers a crucial aspect to our application.  The designer will provide the main aesthetics of the app. The backend developer will deal with the data used and imputed into the app while also maintaining the app. The mobile developer will have experience from generating and creating apps in past projects. Leading the whole team will be the tech project manager ensuring that all deadlines will be met and ensure social cohesion within the group. They will also manage where resources such as funding will be allocated to and determine what will need to be prioritised.  </p>

              <h3>Designer</h3>
              <p>One of the primary roles within the development of an app is the designer. These people oversee the forefront of the app. They design the style and looks of the app, this may come with fonts, colours, text, buttons etc. The designer must keep in contact and always communicate with the team to meet the needs of the user. Therefore, this means that the designer must have good communication skills, team building skills and ideally an eye for aesthetics and aspects. These components should result in a successful app as the app would be pleasing to look at and easy to operate. The design of the app is crucial as it may affect how a user operates and interacts with an app. If an appâ€™s design is too complicated and the user cannot access their information in an efficient manner, they may become disinterested. Designers must be competent with software such as photoshop, Adobe InDesign etc.

              <h3>Backend Developer</h3>
              <p>It is critically significant to employ a backend developer when venturing onto a greater project. Backend developers are crucial as they are responsible for managing data transactions between a user and the servers. The backend developer must be comfortable and confident with multiple programming languages, algorithms and data structuring.  As it is their role to design and create the technology which will be the foundation for the app. Nevertheless, all successful apps require a solid foundation.  Furthermore, they must also possess analytical thinking, great problem-solving skills and have good communication skills. Backend developers are greatly needed as for an app to run as they also run the server-side functions. Without a backend developer the app may result in crashes, bugs and not operate at all in the long run or at a mass rate. </p>
